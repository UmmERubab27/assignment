//45.Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

// Example usage:
const myCar = createCar("Toyota", "Land Cruiser", ["color", "Black"], ["Optional Feature", "sunroof"], ["Speed", "180 - 240 KM/H"]);
