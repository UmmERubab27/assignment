//20.Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

const Countries: string[] = ["USA", "Pakistan","Canada","London","Turkey"]

console.log("List Of Countries");

for(let country of Countries)
{
    console.log(country)
