//12.Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let names: string[] = [`ShakeelaBatool`,`Bushra`, `Hira`,`Mehreen`];

// loop through each name in the array

for (let name of names) 

{

// print a personalize message for each friend

console.log(`Hello ${name}, I Hope You're Having A Funtastic Day!`)

};
